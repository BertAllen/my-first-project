    <h1>My thoughts on Day 1</h1>
<p>covered a lot of material. did a lot of downloading and installing to get ready to start writing professional code. Fell behind a couple of times when I was following one instruction and Jake continued on with the class. A little hectic, but "overall" not too bad of a first day!</p>
